    <td>Our new car supports remote updates so that the manufacturer can send
      firmware updates for bug fixes or new features. The firmware update is always
      encrypted with AES-128 before being sent out and the car decrypts it and checks
      for validity before installing. Seems reasonable enough, right?!  Unfortunately,
      hackers are claiming that they've extracted our firmware key through a power
      side-channel attack on the car's decryption system. By recovering this key
      they are able to decrypt the firmware update to see what's inside!  We
      can't believe this is real! Please show us how it's done - we've attached a
      set of power traces
      that were collected during the beginning of the car's decryption process. Is
      there actually enough information in these traces to extract an AES key?!</td>

    <td>Traffic Dots are devices used in roadways around the world for detecting
      car presence at intersections as well as highways. They communicate with the traffic
      light controller over an unprotected 2.4ghz connection. They report how many cars
      have passed as well as if a car is present over the sensor. These are battery
      powered devices that are put under roads and are expected to last from 5 to 10
      years on battery. The more cars that go over the sensor the faster the battery
      will drain. The software to configure the Traffic Dots is openly given out by
      the manufacturer and through some clever social engineering you managed to get
      access. You put the software on your laptop and got the proper radio technology
      to use the software. You are near an intersection where the traffic is very busy
      in one direction but not the other. There has to be a way to increase traffic
      by modifying these Traffic Dots which may result in someone running a red light
      due to impatience.  Picture of what Traffic Dots look like: <a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Traffic-Sensors-Embedded.jpg">Traffic Dots</a></td>

    <td><b>Scenario:</b> <br /> 1. One morning before the daily IT team meeting,
      Joseph Adams inadvertently installs malware posing as a software update onto his
      corporate Windows VM.  The malware beacons out to a Linux machine outside the
      corporate network and the waiting attacker uses Joe’s Windows 7 VM as a pivot
      point to reach the rest of the internal, corporate network. <br /> 2. The attacker
      locates a Linux-based file server and uses credentials that Joe had stored in
      an unencrypted plaintext file to log in to the file server. <br /> 3. The attacker
      locates a Truecrypt file on the file server, exfiltrates the file, and replaces
      the original file with a second file that he/she has uploaded. <br /> 4. When Joe
      returns from his morning meeting, he notices the attacker is still connected to
      his VM.  He immediately logs in to the hypervisor, suspends the VMs, and retains
      the volatile memory (raw/DD) and virtual hard disk (VMDK) files from the affected
      machines for forensic analysis. <br /> 5. Later that afternoon, the attacker contacts
      the company’s CIO Office and offers up the original file and password for ransom. <br /> 6. The
      corporate CIO would like the internal IR Team to investigate whether the exfiltrated
      Truecrypt file can be recovered without having to pay the ransom. Prove
      that you have found the stolen file by providing its sha1sum. </td>
